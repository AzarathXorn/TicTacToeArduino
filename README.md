This is the ino file for a tic tac toe game using Arduino. 

The game was created on arduino uno with 11 single color LEDs, a thumb stick, and a button.
Uses 2 lights to show which player goes first (human or computer) and blinking lights
The code also uses a set of functions to have a computer play against the player.

The computer logic is based on Collin Bardini's Tic Tac Toe AI from CISP400, as well as 
https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-never-lose-at-Tic-Tac-Toe.

It is not possible to win against the AI, as far as our tests have shown.
